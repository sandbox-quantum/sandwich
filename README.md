# Sandwich

Sandwich is a multi-platform, multi-language, open-source library that provides
a simple unified API for developers to use (multiple) cryptographic libraries
in their applications. Find documentation
[here](https://sandbox-quantum.github.io/sandwich).

## Status & API stability

### Security

**WARNING**: This library is under current security review by a
third-party company. We will release a new version fixing the
findings found during that audit.

### API stability

Sandwich version is current `v0.x.y`. Until Sandwich v1.0.0 is
released, expect some breaking changes in the various APIs.
