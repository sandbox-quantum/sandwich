# TLS connections made simple

After the installation process, let's see how simple it is to make a TLS connection.

## Python

- [TLS connection with Sandwich](./TLS_Sandwich.md): How to write a simple TLS connection in Python SSL and convert to Pysandwich, we also benchmark performance of Pysandwich versus `ssl` library in Python for comparison.
- [TLS Sandwich with AsyncIO](./TLS_AsyncIO.md): With AsyncIO, we can easily boost the total number of connection per second to much better than in the previous chapter.
