Sandwich Rust has two folders:

- [`Rust API`](Rust/API-doc.md): The actual Rust API provides to Rust developers. Link to Rust doc [is here]().
- [`Rust FFI`](Rust/ffi.md): Provide Sandwich high-level API from `Sandwich Backend`. Its purpose is to provide stable binding to Go, Python, C/C++. If you use Rust, you should directly use Rust API. This following section describe Rust FFI.
