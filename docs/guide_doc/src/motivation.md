# Why Sandwich?

> Sandwich library: Crypto-agility you will actually use

Implementing cryptography in your code is hard and needs technical knowledge (understanding of protocols, mathematical proofs, algorithms and the trade-offs between them) and coding expertise (to implement the chosen cryptography).

These create barriers that result in:

- Junior developers implementing cryptographic algorithms incorrectly and insecurely
- Extensive amount of time and effort being spent on building and testing secure channels
- It is tough for developers to quickly switch their cryptography with current solutions
- Paying for third-party security can be expensive / unsustainable

Sandwich attempts to reduce these barriers by providing developers with a **simple unified API** that allows them to import cryptography within their code.

Sandwich would save the users time, effort, money and give them a sense of security as the library has been vetted by security experts and the crypto community.
